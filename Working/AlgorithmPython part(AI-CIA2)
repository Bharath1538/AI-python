Working/Algorithm for the Python Code
Step1:
Take input from the user for the number of split words to be entered.
Step2:
Get the inputs.
Step3:
Using a user-defined function and for loops check for the last two letters and the first two letters of any element matches.
Step4:
If it matches take the remaining part of the second element and add it to the first word.
Step5:
Now remove the joined element accordingly.
Step6:
Do all these steps in a recursive manner by calling the function recursively.
Step7:
Print the final output.
#Here the input part can be removed and the commented list part can be used to create a pre-defined input based working.
